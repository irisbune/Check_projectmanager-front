## A Project Management tool

A Project Management tool with a Rails back-end, using JSON, and a ReactJS front-end.
We worked on this project in a team of 4, during our 5-week Web Developer Bootcamp.
We built the initial version in 1 week.

This project will be a work-in-progress, as I'm planning to improve this and add more features to practice my skills.

### Team
- [Matthew LaPorte](https://github.com/ml7757)
- [Khalil Gharbaoui](https://github.com/khalilgharbaoui)
- [Mauricio Garcia](https://github.com/MauricioGarc1a)
- [Iris Bune](https://github.com/irisbune)

### Info
Four weeks into our [Codaisseur's](https://github.com/Codaisseur) Web Dev Bootcamp, we had to build a
[Rails api](https://github.com/irisbune/Check_projectmanager-back) (JSON) and use ReactJS as the front-end.

The front now includes a list of projects, links to individual project pages with a list of related tasks.
Via the task form, new tasks can be added to each project. Tasks can be toggled complete.
Both projects and tasks can be deleted.

### Todos
My personal goal is to add:
- Inline editing of projects and improve for tasks
- User components, incl authorisation
- Comment components
- Improve styling with [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/)
